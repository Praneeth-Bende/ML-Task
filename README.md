### Short Summary of Findings  
Top 3 most profitable products were identified based on total sales, highlighting key revenue-generating items. These products should be prioritized for marketing and inventory management.  
Customer segmentation using K-Means clustering showed that the most loyal customers are premium buyers, older families, and young singles. Premium customers tend to have high spending habits, older families buy in bulk, and young singles make frequent lower-value purchases.  
A key hypothesis is that premium buyers prefer high-quality branded products, older families focus on bulk household purchases, and young singles prioritize convenience. Marketing strategies should target premium customers and families while offering loyalty incentives for frequent buyers.
